        <h1>India</h1>
        <p>India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[22] is a country in South Asia. It is the
            seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[23][24] and from the time of its
            independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[25][26][27] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the
            south, the
            Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan
            to the
            west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar[k] to the east. In the Indian
            Ocean, India is
            in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with
            Thailand,
            Myanmar, and Indonesia.

            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[28][29][30]
            Their long
            occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
            second only
            to Africa in human genetic diversity.[31] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of
            the Indus
            river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium
            BCE.[32] By
            1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the
            northwest.[33][34]
            Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely
            vigilant,
            the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[35] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted
            in the
            northern and western regions.[36] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within
            Hinduism,[37] and
            Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[38] Early political
            consolidations gave
            rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[39] Their collective era was
            suffused with
            wide-ranging creativity,[40] but also marked by the declining status of women,[41] and the incorporation of
            untouchability into an organised system of belief.[l][42] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported
            Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[43]</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <h3>Ancient India</h3>
        <p>About 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
            Africa,
            where they had earlier evolved.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to
            about 30,000
            years ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of
            permanent
            structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan,
            Pakistan.[84] These
            gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86]
            which
            flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] Centred around cities such as
            Mohenjo-daro, Harappa,
            Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in
            crafts
            production and wide-ranging trade.[86]

            During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures
            to the Iron
            Age ones.[88] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[89] were composed during this
            period,[90] and
            historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic
            Plain.[88] Most
            historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the
            subcontinent
            from the north-west.[89] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free
            peasants, but which
            excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[91] On the
            Deccan Plateau,
            archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political
            organisation.[88] In
            South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating
            from this
            period,[92] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[92]</p>

        <h1>Medieval India</h1>
        <p>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural
            diversity.[111] When
            Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand
            southwards, he was
            defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[112] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was
            defeated by
            the Pala king of Bengal.[112] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the
            Pallavas from
            farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[112] No
            ruler of this
            period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[111]
            During this time,
            pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were
            accommodated within
            caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[113] The caste system consequently began to show
            regional
            differences.[113]

            In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[114] They were
            imitated all
            over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the
            subcontinent.[114] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great
            numbers to the
            capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[115] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear
            everywhere as
            India underwent another urbanisation.[115] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in Southeast
            Asia, as
            South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar,
            Thailand,
            Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[116] Indian merchants, scholars, and
            sometimes
            armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the initiative as well, with many
            sojourning in Indian
            seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[116]</p>

        <h1>Modern India</h1>
        <p>Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848
            of Lord
            Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern
            state. These
            included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the
            education of
            citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long
            after their
            introduction in Europe.[142][143][144][145] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this
            time and set
            off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive
            British-style social
            reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked
            many regions
            of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[146][147] Although the rebellion
            was suppressed
            by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the
            British
            government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the
            new rulers
            also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[148][149] In the
            decades
            following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian
            National
            Congress in 1885.[150][151][152][153]

            The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was
            marked by
            economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[154] There was
            an increase
            in the number of large-scale famines,[155] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by
            Indian
            taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[156] There were also salutary effects:
            commercial
            cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal
            consumption.[157] The
            railway network provided critical famine relief,[158] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[158] and
            helped nascent
            Indian-owned industry.[157]</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h1>Geography</h1>
        <p>India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part of the
            Indo-Australian Plate.[173] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian
            Plate, then
            part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to
            its
            south-west, and later, south and south-east.[173] Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its
            northeast,
            began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate.[173] These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's
            mantle, both
            created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to
            uplift the
            Himalayas.[173] Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped
            trough that
            rapidly filled with river-borne sediment[174] and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic Plain.[175] The original
            Indian
            plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range, which extends from the
            Delhi Ridge in
            a southwesterly direction. To the west lies the Thar Desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the
            Aravallis.[176][177][178]</p>

        <h1>Biodiversity</h1>
        <p>India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and
            contain
            many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[198] India is a habitat for 8.6% of all mammal
            species, 13.7%
            of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all
            flowering
            plant species.[199][200] Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic.[201] India also contains four of
            the world's
            34 biodiversity hotspots,[70] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high
            endemism.[o][202]

            According to official statistics, India's forest cover is 713,789 km2 (275,595 sq mi), which is 21.71% of
            the country's
            total land area.[71] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density, or the proportion
            of the area
            of a forest covered by its tree canopy.[203] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is greater than 70%,
            occupies 3.02%
            of India's land area.[203][204] It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands, the
            Western Ghats,
            and Northeast India. Moderately dense forest, whose canopy density is between 40% and 70%, occupies 9.39% of
            India's
            land area.[203][204] It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist
            deciduous sal forest
            of eastern India, and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India.[205] Open forest, whose
            canopy
            density is between 10% and 40%, occupies 9.26% of India's land area.[203][204] India has two natural zones
            of thorn
            forest, one in the Deccan Plateau, immediately east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part
            of the
            Indo-Gangetic plain, now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation, its features no longer
            visible.[206]</p>
